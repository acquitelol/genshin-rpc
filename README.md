 gluta

 this is a program built in the electron boilerplate to add customization to your rich presence on discord for genshin impact.
 it includes a preview of the rich presence and you can control everything from the elapsed time state to the button links

 to use it, its as simple as this:

 1. download the dmg for your mac (intel or m1 aka arm64)
 2. install it and open it. you will be greeted with a screen which shows empty boxes (hopefully)
 3. go to the discord developer portal (https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new application
 4. the name that you give this is the name of the rich presence, so be careful (calling it Genshin Impact is the best way to go)
 5. go to oath2 and click "copy" on the client id box
 6. open gluta and paste the string in the "client id" box
 7. now customize the rich presence to your needs! here are some things to keep in mind
 8. the default large and small image are clickable, to change the images you need to go back to the discord developer portal, and
 click on the application name, then go to "Rich Presence" and then "Art Assets". once you are here, upload your large and small image
 and give them a name
 9. go back to gluta, and click on the default images, the large || small image hover is what will apppear when you hover over the image in discord
 10. the large || small image identifier is what you called the image in the developer portal. please make sure it is the same as the one in the dev portal
 (its caps sensitive!)


 here are some more things to keep in mind:

 please note that all boxes must be filled for the rich presence to begin

 please also note you must have the regular, canary, or PTB client open *before* you start the rich presence

 please also note that the data which you input is saved to your cache, aka it loads the rich presence automatically when you start the program

 as well as this, please also note that the Timer/Stopwatch in the program is clickable (it can be turned on and off!)

 lastly, please note that the preview in the program is just a representation and is not the actual rich presence, it was recreated with HTML + CSS
 as a vizualisation of the rich presence
